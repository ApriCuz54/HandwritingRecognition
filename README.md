# HandwritingRecognition

Welcome to our handwriting recognition model exploration project! In this endeavor, we delved into the fascinating world of deep learning, specifically focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Our primary motivation was to gain a comprehensive understanding of these neural network architectures and their applications in the realm of handwriting recognition.

## Project Objectives:

Reference Model Implementation: We initiated our journey by implementing a handwriting recognition model based on a code found on Kaggle. This served as our starting point, providing a foundation for our subsequent experiments and modifications.
Architectural Exploration: Our primary goal was to comprehensively explore the use of CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs. We wanted to understand the nuances of each architecture and their combined effects on the model's performance in handwriting recognition tasks.
Model Modification and Tuning: We went beyond the reference model by experimenting with various modifications. This included adding more CNN layers, incorporating additional bidirectional LSTM layers, adjusting batch sizes, and exploring different image preprocessing techniques. Our objective was to dissect the impact of these changes on the model's accuracy and efficiency.
